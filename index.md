# Research Interests

My research interests in 3D spatial perception for robotics; specifically how to create actionable and hierarchical semantic representations.
A good example of this is [Foundations of Spatial Perception for Robotics: Hierarchical Representations and Real-time Systems](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02783649241229725), and the associated software system [Hydra](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra).
A video demonstration of Hydra is below.

# Bio

I am currently a PhD student at MIT in the AeroAstro department, affiliated with the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).
I work in the SPARK Lab and am advised by Prof. Luca Carlone.
I received my M.S. from MIT in 2022.
Before starting my graduate studies at MIT in 2020, I was at MIT Lincoln Laboratory between 2016 and 2020.
I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Robotics Engineering from WPI in 2016.
